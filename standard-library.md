# Standard Library
This is specification for the expected Standard Library every interpreter should cover.

The Standard Library is available automatically without a need for imports. Every feature of this library should behave as if they were implemented in XMLang, but do not have to be. In all likelihood most if not all tags will not be implemented in XMLang, though this is up to the interpreter implementation where possible. The Standard Library should follow the goals set out in [the README](README.md)
